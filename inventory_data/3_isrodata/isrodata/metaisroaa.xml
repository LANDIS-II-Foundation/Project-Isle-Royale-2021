    <attracc>
      <attraccr>The attributes for the accuracy assessment were recorded in the field in July - September, 1998. Vegetation associations were identified based on the field key and plant identification.  If additional communities were found within a 50 meter radius of the plot center, they were recorded as well.  During the analysis, it was concluded that some attributes were in error and changed to match the mapped attributes.  This was done by examination of the aerial photographs under stereoscopic view.  The attributes were in error due to 1) spatial error in the GPS derived coordinates (4-8 meters), 2) change of vegetation community due to temporal changes, or differences between observation team identifications.</attraccr>

The resulting INFO file was exported into a text file, imported into a spreadsheet, and the attributes from the accuracy assessment and the spatial data were compared.

    <overview>
      <eaover>The National Vegetation Classification Standard is organized hierarchically to support conservation and resource stewardship applications across multiple scales. The upper levels of the hierarchy are based on the physical form or structure of the vegetation (physiognomy) and have been refined from the international standards developed by the United nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO). The two most detailed levels of the hierarchy are based on the species composition of existing vegetation (floristics) and reflect the phyto-sociological standards that were originally developed by European ecologists. The vegetation classification is continually advanced through the collection and analysis of new field data and will be greatly strengthened during the course of the USGS-NPS mapping efforts. Data file attributes include species, alliance, community element, and land cover.
