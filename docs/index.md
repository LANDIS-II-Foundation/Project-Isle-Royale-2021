## Welcome to the Isle Royale LANDIS Project Page

Isle Royale has been the site of research into moose, wolf, and vegetation dynamics for decades. Our most recent project builds on that past work to create projections for future dynamics of vegetation, soil carbon, and moose populations into the future. The project is driven by the uncertainties of how climate and browsing -- both hugely important processes in northern and boreal forests -- will interact to determine the future vegetation states and carbon stocks in the boreal zone. 

### Past research

The simulation model we use here is a continuation of work by Nathan De Jager, Matthew Duvenick, Brian Miranda, Eric Gustafson, and others. See citations:

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Project-Isle-Royale-2021/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
