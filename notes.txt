Desired raster format is NAD83 Zone 17N, EPSG:26917 
To update to Biomass v6:
	Move data from BiomassSuccession3.txt to SpeciesData.csv
	Move data from pnet_2_landis_a1_isro_2.txt to SppEcoregionData.csv
	Find mortality probability data TODO For now, replaced with 0.01
	FireReductionParameters and HarvestReductionParameters copied from example
	Error due to something related to inactive sites

Rob fixed error with Biomass Succession
Model appears to be running with new succession and browse
TODO: identify low-lying waterlogged areas

Progress on ISRO -- trying to fit beaver habitat
	message about browse proportion > 1
	L382 in event.cs
	step size in biomass succession
	look at how much disturbance there is

Got most everything updated, except for species parameters and climate. Rasters and IC are ready to go. 
Borrowing species parameters from Melissa Lucash for now: https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Project-MN-Climate-Change-2017/blob/master/Inputs/Disturbances_Paper/212N_Landscape_Final_Files/Century_succession-4ha_092716_1y.txt

switched to using FIA for biomass

2021-10-5
Rasters all done and exported, except for ecoregions
Borrowed climate data from Melissa Lucash; TODO find specific climate data and downscale with data from Nate

2021-10-7
Rasters weren't all done -- had to do a lot of fiddling.
Included all trees, with catch-all hardwood and softwood "species" to fix problem with some plots not being in the raster,

TODO Make new functional types, not just hardwood and softwood
TODO fix the ANPP species data
TODO climate data!
TODO add willow and alder

Fixed Nitrogen problem --denitrification rates were too low

To do: reduce resolution
	address issue with too much forage
	Replace initial biomass with Keeling curve
