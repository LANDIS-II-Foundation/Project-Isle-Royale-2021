Got most everything updated, except for species parameters and climate. Rasters and IC are ready to go. 
Borrowing species parameters from Melissa Lucash for now: https://github.com/LANDIS-II-Foundation/Project-MN-Climate-Change-2017/blob/master/Inputs/Disturbances_Paper/212N_Landscape_Final_Files/Century_succession-4ha_092716_1y.txt
